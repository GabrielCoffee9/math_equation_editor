`math_equation_editor` is a free and open source Flutter offline application for desktop that allows easy editing and exporting math equations. 
It has a custom-made fully integrated math keyboard in _Flutter only_ - no plugins, no web views.

A HUGE thanks to [simpleclub](https://github.com/simpleclub) that made the original [math_keyboard](https://github.com/simpleclub/math_keyboard.git) ! 

This application uses a [math_keyboard fork](https://github.com/GabrielCoffee9/math_keyboard) for personalized new buttons and features.
